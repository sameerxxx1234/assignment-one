    <center><h1>History of Hockey</h1></center>
    <h3>What is Hockey?</h3>
    <p>Hockey is a team sport played on a field or an indoor rink, depending on the variant of the game. It is played with a small, hard ball or a puck, and players use sticks to hit the ball or puck into the opponent's goal while defending their own goal. Hockey is a fast-paced and physically demanding sport that requires agility, skill, and teamwork.
<br><br>
        There are several variants of hockey, including field hockey, ice hockey, and street hockey. Here's an overview of each:
        Field Hockey:

       <h3> Field hockey:</h3> is played on a grass or artificial turf field, typically outdoors.
        Each team consists of 11 players, including a goalkeeper, who wears protective gear and defends the goal.
        Players use curved sticks with a flat side to control and hit the ball, aiming to score goals by hitting it into the opponent's goal.
        The objective is to score more goals than the opposing team within the allotted game time, usually two halves of 35 minutes each.
        Ice Hockey:
        
        <h3>Ice hockey:</h3> is played on an ice rink, usually indoors, with teams of six players (including a goaltender) on the ice at a time.
        Players wear ice skates and use hockey sticks to control a hard rubber puck.
        The objective is to score goals by shooting the puck into the opponent's net while defending their own net.
        Ice hockey is known for its physicality, speed, and fluid gameplay, with frequent player substitutions and line changes.
        Street Hockey:
        
        <h3>Street hockey:</h3> is a variation of hockey played on non-ice surfaces, such as streets, driveways, or outdoor courts.
        Players use inline skates or sneakers and hockey sticks to play with a ball or a puck.
        The rules and equipment may vary depending on the level of play and the preferences of the participants.
        Street hockey is often played in informal settings and can be adapted to accommodate players of different ages and skill levels.
        Hockey is a popular sport worldwide, with professional leagues and competitions in many countries. It promotes physical fitness, hand-eye coordination, and teamwork while providing an exciting and competitive experience for players and fans alike.
