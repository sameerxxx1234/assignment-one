    <h3>What is Swimming?</h3>
    <p>Swimming is a popular aquatic sport that involves using one's arms and legs to move through water. It is not only a recreational activity but also a competitive sport practiced at various levels, from local swimming clubs to international competitions like the Olympic Games. <br><br>

        In competitive swimming, athletes race against each other over various distances and strokes, with events ranging from short sprints to long-distance races. The four main strokes in competitive swimming are: <br><br>
        
        <h3>Freestyle:</h3>
         Also known as front crawl, swimmers use a alternating arm motion combined with a flutter kick to propel themselves through the water. This stroke is often the fastest and most commonly used in freestyle events. <br>
        
        <h3>Backstroke:</h3>
         Swimmers lie on their backs and perform an alternating arm motion combined with a flutter kick. In backstroke events, swimmers race while on their backs, relying on their ability to maintain orientation and speed. <br>
        
       <h3>Breaststroke:</h3>
        Swimmers perform a simultaneous arm motion (pull) followed by a simultaneous leg motion (kick), with the head staying above water throughout. Breaststroke is characterized by its frog-like kick and requires coordination between arm and leg movements. <br>
        
        <h3>Butterfly:</h3>
         Swimmers use a simultaneous arm motion (pull) combined with an undulating dolphin kick, where both legs move up and down together. Butterfly is known for its demanding technique and powerful movements.
        
        Competitive swimming events can include individual races in each stroke, as well as medley events where swimmers compete in all four strokes in a predetermined order. Additionally, relay events involve teams of swimmers completing designated distances, with each team member swimming a different leg of the race.
        
        Swimming offers numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, and flexibility. It is also a valuable life skill that can enhance water safety and confidence in aquatic environments.</p>
